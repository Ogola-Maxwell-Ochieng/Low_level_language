## Introduction

C is a Low-level programming language and it involves a deep understanding of hardware, memory management, and system-level interactions. Whether a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository offers a collection of well-organized folders and files to support your C low-level programming journey.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `01-Hello-world(Inputs and Outputs)`: Printing our first program in C language "Hello, World!" and basic introduction to C low-level programming like input and output operations.
- `02-Variables and Data types`: Understanding data types like **int**, **float**, **char**, **double** etc. Declaring and initializing variables in C.
- `03-Condition Statements`: Understanding and effectively using control statements in writing efficient and organized C programs. These statements (**if, else if, else and switch statements**) provide a means to implement complex logic, handling user input, iterating through data structures, and make programs responsive to changing conditions.
- `04-Functions`: Declaring and defining functions.Function parameters and return values.Function prototypes. Declaring and using function pointers. Writing recursive functions.
- `05-Pointers`: Understanding pointers and memory addresses.Pointer arithmetic.Pointer dereferencing.
- `06-Arrays` : Declaring and initializing arrays.Accessing elements.Array indexing. Working with 2D and 3D arrays.
- `07-memory-management`: Memory management and manipulation in C. Handling errors and much much more...

Each folder contains code examples and documentation related to the respective topic.

## Getting Started
